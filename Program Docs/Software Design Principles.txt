Requirements are bound to change - more older, more probable. So, Design/Code flexible
Do not write the code you dont need NOW AND Delete the code that you dont need NOW.
Incremental Design- Release earlier - iterate
	Redisgn at each step (as if system is designed to do the things it does NOW) - DO NOT hack when iterate
Dont be too generic - add code that is valuable to users
Follow strict code review process
