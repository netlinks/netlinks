=========================

In net links we can imagine differnt kinds of apps.

- APPs that run locally hosted code. These apps are simple, light weight. These APPS are system apps, which comes by default - image viewer, video player, calculator, etc..
	- APPS that doesnt take any inputs. These apps are simple, standalone one. Doesnt do much. Eg, Calculator, minesweeper
	- APPS that take inputs, but does not write. Eg, image viewer, Youtube player, etc.
	- APPS that take inputs and saves it. eg, simple text editor.

- APPS hosted in external servers,
	- APPS that doesnt take any input from netlinks - most of the web apps falls in to this category - eg-Wikipedia, Facebook, youtube
	- APPS that take input file, but doesnt write any files - eg - External PDF viewer, Word viewer.
	- APPS that take input file and saves it back. Eg, advanced image editor, text editor - eg pixlr, lucid chart.


**Need to make general rules for the above.
